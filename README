There are two boolean translations of the Linux kernel available, one that
uses 1 variable per Kconfig config, and another that uses 2 variables per
config named 1var and 2var respectively. The 1var translation is more mature,
however, the 2var translation is more accurate.

Currently, the 2var translation does not handle the following:
    - String, Int and Hex configs.
    - Ranges.
